For the purposes of this particular quest, you'll be building a cheap breeder reactor to make <66>Plutonium<rr>. This is a very basic reactor and can be changed to run faster and safer. Alternatively, reactors can be designed to produce a decent amount of power for the mid game of the pack.<nl><nl>First, set up your 54 <66>Reactor Casings<rr> to encase a 3x3 cube shape of empty air. The Casings should only cover the faces of the interior cube, not the edges or corners. You should have exactly the right number of Casings to encase a 3x3 space.<nl><nl>Next, create a hole so you can get inside the cube. Place the <66>Reactor Cells<rr> in all 8 corners. Then the <66>Lapis Coolers<rr> will go between them: 4 on the top layer and 4 on the bottom layer. At this point, the top and bottom layers should have eight blocks each with an empty middle, and the middle layer is fully empty. In the middle layer, place the 4 <66>Graphite Blocks<rr> on the corners, and the 4 <66>Glowstone Coolers<rr> on the sides (so they touch both Lapis Coolers). Now the cube should be full, except for an empty column in the middle. The reactor will now be complete when you reseal it up with the Casings you removed to access the interior.<nl><nl>Finally, place the <33>Fission Reactor Controller<rr> along any edge or corner of the reactor. Opening the Reactor Controller GUI should let you know that the structure was properly formed; if not, go back and check what you did wrong.<nl><nl>The lever is placed on the reactor, as a redstone signal is required for it to start working. <cc>Reactors can overheat and melt if the temperature exceeds its ability to cool.<rr> You can make a safety loop on the controller (instead of the lever) to automatically shut off the reactor when it starts getting hot using a <aa>Redstone Conduit<rr>, a <aa>Redstone Sensor Filter<rr> (on the input channel), and a <aa>Redstone NOT Filter<rr> (on the output channel).

nomifactory.quest.db.536.title=ZPM Machine Hulls
nomifactory.quest.db.536.desc=<66>ZPM Machine Hulls<rr> are made with <66>Iridium Plates<rr>, but you'll notice they also need <99>Polytetrafluoroethylene<rr> (more commonly known as Teflon™), a special plastic which will be required for all machine hulls going forward.<nl><nl>ZPM stands for Zero Point Module.<nl><nl>This is the last tier of machine that's sensible to produce before you reach the <dd>Creative Portable Tank<rr>. Multiblock hatches are a different matter: feel free to upgrade your <33>EBF<rr>s to Ultimate Voltage, if you can handle the power drain.<nl>

nomifactory.quest.db.537.title=Sterilized Growth Medium
nomifactory.quest.db.537.desc=<99>Sterilized Growth Medium<rr> is needed for <66>Wetware Circuits<rr>.<nl><nl>You'll need to mix <66>Mincemeat<rr>, <66>Sugar<rr>, and <66>Tiny piles of Salt<rr> with water in a mixer to make <99>Raw Growth Medium<rr>, then use a <33>Fluid Heater<rr> to sterilize it.<nl><nl>Mincemeat comes from pulverizing any kind of animal meat.

nomifactory.quest.db.540.title=MV Extruder
nomifactory.quest.db.540.desc=The <33>Extruder<rr> is an alternative way to form shapes from metal. <aa>Extruder Shapes<rr> are used for telling an Extruder which shape to make.<nl><nl>Extruders are the only way to make certain things, like <66>Large Pipes<rr>. Extruders use ingots, but are as efficient for making <66>Gears<rr> as melting and solidifying.<nl><nl>You can also use Extruders to make things from other machines like plates and wires, but they are less efficient than using the dedicated machines for these purposes.

# db 541
nomifactory.quest.db.541.title=More Blast Furnaces
nomifactory.quest.db.541.desc=Overclocking aside, as you continue to progress in <55>Nomifactory<ff>, materials made in the <33>Electric Blast Furnace<ff> will take longer to complete. <ee>More advanced coils do not give speed bonuses<ff>, only allowing for the furnace to <ee>get hot enough to process more advanced materials<ff>.<nl><nl>Consequently, you'll need to continually expand your smelting and power generation infrastructure.<nl><nl>You don't have to get all four of these Electric Blast Furnaces completed and running just yet, but be prepared to make many of them over the course of the pack.

nomifactory.quest.db.546.desc=Note: this quest accepts both LV and MV Distillery.<nl><nl>If you don't feel up to making a <33>Distillation Tower<rr> just yet, you can get <99>Ethanol<rr> via a single block <33>Distillery<rr>, a machine that gets one fluid output per <66>Integrated Circuit<rr> configuration, while the <33>Distillation Tower<rr> gives all possible outputs for the input fluid. This defers the tower for a little while longer.<nl><nl>However, the Distillation Tower is mandatory for advanced chemistry, as most things have more than one important output: <99>Fermented Biomass<rr>, <99>Charcoal Byproducts<rr> from your <33>Pyrolyse Oven<rr>, and the entire line of petrochemicals from <99>Oil<rr>, to name a few.<nl><nl>Can't avoid it forever!<nl><nl>

# db 547
nomifactory.quest.db.547.title=Scanner Module: Block
nomifactory.quest.db.547.desc=A good way to find a specific ore you're missing is the <66>Scanner Module: Block<rr> for your Scanner. <66>Sneak-right click<ff> a piece of ore you want to search for with a Module in your hand, then <66>sneak-right click<ff> the <aa>Scanner<ff>, put the module inside, and go wander around scanning. <nl><nl>The range is significantly longer than it is when using the modules which detect all ores, and you even have room for a second <66>Range Module<ff> if you've got an <66>Ender Pearl<ff> to craft one.<nl><nl>You can combo this with ores bought from <dd>Nomicoins<ff> to act as a "sample" to easily find a full vein with the Block Module.

# db 548
nomifactory.quest.db.548.title=Molds
nomifactory.quest.db.548.desc=<aa>Molds<rr> are used in a <33>Fluid Solidifier<rr> or <33>Alloy Smelter<rr> to form materials into specific shapes. These are not consumed or damaged during crafting, so you can leave them in a machine to dedicate it to that shape.<nl><nl>The Fluid Solidifier tends to be the more efficient option: for example, you can use <ee>8 ingots<rr> to make one <66>Gear<rr> in an Alloy Smelter, but with a Fluid Extractor and Solidifier you can accomplish the same result with <ee>4 ingots<rr>.<nl><nl>Be careful not to accidentally make <aa>Extruder Shapes<rr>. Those are for a machine you will get access to later. The three molds in this quest are ones you will find useful right away.

# db 549
nomifactory.quest.db.549.title=Oil Drilling Rig
nomifactory.quest.db.549.desc=If you don't like the idea of mining out Oilsands veins, you can build an <33>Oil Drilling Rig<rr>.<nl><nl>You'll need to provide it with power, <99>Drilling Fluid<rr>, and a steady supply of <66>Pipes<rr>. The Pipes only have a 1%% chance to break per bucket of <99>Oil<rr> drilled.<nl><nl>You'll need to supply at least <ee>HV power<rr> to your rig, and it will overclock with higher energy tiers. Positions of hatches and buses can be swapped with any <66>Solid Steel Machine Casing<rr>.<nl><nl>If the multiblock preview in <bb>JEI<rr> is confusing, note that you can <ee>hold shift and drag-right-click<rr> to scale the preview to fit the window. Place then <66>sneak-right click<rr> the controller block with an empty hand to enable the in-world preview.<nl><nl>Keep in mind when placing the structure that there are 12 pipes that extend downward from the level of the controller.<nl>

# db 550
nomifactory.quest.db.550.title=Vertical Digger
nomifactory.quest.db.550.desc=Place the <33>Vertical Digger<rr> over an ore vein, feed it RF, and it will mine up the entire vein for you.<nl><nl>For drills, you will need a <66>GregTech Drill<rr> (any LV drill will work), a <66>Fluxbore<rr> (Reinforced tier is required) and an <66>Actually Additions Drill<rr> (any color is fine, but take out any augments you wish to keep).<nl><nl>The GregTech Drill will not be consumed, but everything else will be.

# db 551
nomifactory.quest.db.551.title=Phantom Booster
nomifactory.quest.db.551.desc=Up to three <aa>Phantom Boosters<rr> can be placed atop the <33>Vertical Digger<rr> to increase its area of effect.<nl><nl>These are also useful for extending the range of other "Phantom" machines and devices from <bb>Actually Additions<rr>.

nomifactory.quest.db.552.title=Leadstone Jetpack
nomifactory.quest.db.552.desc=Being able to fly is pretty sick. It's also pretty expensive.<nl><nl>It's probably a bit premature to consider a <66>jetpack<rr> at this point, but if you really want to craft this bad boy, I won't stop you.<nl><nl>There's also a quest chain for <bb>EnderIO<rr> Jetpacks (starting with the <66>Conductive Iron Jetpack<rr>). Eventually you'll need to make both, but not for a long time, so feel free to ignore at least one of these quest chains unless you really really like flying.<nl><nl>If the <66>Jetpack<rr> overview and information from <bb>The One Probe<rr> conflict, they can be adjusted through the <bb>Simply Jetpacks 2<rr> <ee>Configuration file<rr> or the command <66>/topcfg<rr> respectively.

nomifactory.quest.db.556.desc=Now that you have a <33>Wiremill<ff> and a <33>Compressor<ff>, you can consider starting to do <ee>Bounties<ff>. The <66>Bounty Board<ff> has a global inventory containing quests to turn in specific items in exchange for <dd>Nomicoins<ff>.

# db 558
nomifactory.quest.db.558.title=Fuel Catalyzers
nomifactory.quest.db.558.desc=This is an augment that will work in all <33>dynamos<ff>. It increases the efficiency of the fuel being used inside the dynamo, increasing the power it generates. However, the rate of power generation remains the same, the fuel simply lasts longer. So, while <66>Fuel Catalyzers<ff> decrease the amount you'll need to go mining for <66>Coal<ff>, they won't boost your production of RF per second.<nl><nl>Each Fuel Catalyzer increases fuel efficiency by <aa>15%%<ff>, additively (so two will make fuel last <aa>30%% longer<ff>, three is <aa>45%% longer<ff>, etc.).

# db 559
nomifactory.quest.db.559.title=Auxiliary Transmission Coils
nomifactory.quest.db.559.desc=The <aa>Auxiliary Transmission Coil <rr>is an augment that will work in all types of dynamos. It will consume fuel faster to produce a correspondingly higher RF per tick.<nl><nl>Each augment increases both base power production and fuel consumption by 100%%, additively (so the second is 200%%, third is 300%%, etc.).<nl><nl>Consider the tradeoffs however, as you could just make another dynamo, and you miss out on <aa>Fuel Catalyzer<rr> augments that make fuels burn longer for more total RF generated. The Auxiliary Transmission Coil will put additional stress your fuel production infrastructure.<nl><nl>If that's an acceptable tradeoff, then Auxiliary Transmission Coils are a cheap and effective way to boost your power production.

# db 564
nomifactory.quest.db.564.title=Neutronium Solar Panel
nomifactory.quest.db.564.desc=How much do you think these solar panels weigh? <nl><nl>These are quite expensive and two of them are required for each Tier Ten Micro Miner.<nl><nl><66>Neutronium Solar Panels<rr> generate an enormous amount of RF power in sunlight, so once you get your tank it's also a good choice for compact power generation.<nl><nl>Protip: it's always daytime in space.

# db 580
nomifactory.quest.db.580.title=Blast Furnaces Galore
nomifactory.quest.db.580.desc=As you continue to progress, crafting times for more advanced <33>Electric Blast Furnace<rr> recipes will continue to increase. More advanced coils do not give speed bonuses, they just increase the operating temperature so you can smelt more advanced materials.<nl><nl>To compensate, you'll need to get your infrastructure for smelting, as well as for power generation, up to snuff.<nl><nl>You don't need to get all eight of these completed and running just yet, but plan to at some point in the future. Instead of upgrading existing EBFs, have them passively automating a stock of materials and build new EBFs with higher specifications for new materials.<nl><nl>

nomifactory.quest.db.789.desc=<aa>Filters<rr> are a type of machine cover that controls what items or fluids are allowed to pass through it. They can be used directly on the side of a machine to affect external automation or the Machine's <aa>Auto-Output Functionality<rr>.<nl><nl>You can also <ee>place filters inside of other covers<rr> to control what items or fluids that cover will interact with. When used in a <66>Robot Arm<rr>, <aa>Item Filters<rr> make for a powerful automation tool for <ee>keeping specific items in stock<rr> in specific quantities in Machines. With <66>Fluid Regulators<rr>, similar behavior is possible with fluids using a <aa>Fluid Filter<rr>. For <66>Conveyors<rr> and <66>Pumps<rr>, it simply limits what that cover will move.<nl><nl><aa>Filters<rr> all have 9 configurable slots and whitelist/blacklist modes, and can be applied to multiple sides of machines. When placed inside a <66>Robot Arm<rr> in <ee>Keep Exact<rr> or <ee>Supply Exact<rr> mode<rr>, the item count in a filter can be incremented by <ee>Right Clicking<rr> and decremented by <ee>Left Clicking<rr>. Holding <ee>Shift<rr> causes the count to increase/decrease by a factor of 2. This controls the number of each type of item that will be kept in stock or moved at a time.<nl><nl>Similar controls are available for the <aa>Fluid Filter<rr> when placed inside a <66>Fluid Regulator<rr>.<nl><nl>Additionally, the <aa>Ore Dictionary Filter<rr><rr> is a powerful tool that has a specialized filter which uses ore dictionary entries and supports "*" as a wildcard, e. g. "<66>ingotHot*<rr>" will match all hot ingots, "<66>dustRegular*<rr>" will match all regular dusts, and "<66>dustTiny*<rr>" will match all tiny piles.<nl><nl>All <bb>GregTech<rr> Filters can be configured using ghost items from <bb>JEI<rr>.

This means it also works for things like <66>Chests<rr>, <66>Drums<rr>, and Multiblock inputs.<nl><nl>The cover works by detecting a <ee>redstone signal<rr>. By default, the entire machine will be disabled if a sufficiently strong signal is detected by the cover.<nl><nl>When you open the Machine Controller's GUI with a <aa>Screwdriver<rr>, you will see several options for configuring its behavior:<nl><nl>The strength of the signal required to trigger the Machine Controller is configurable using the top slider.<nl><nl>Another button allows you to select whether to control the whole machine (where applicable) or a specific cover. This lets you do things like stop moving items into a machine, but also allow the machine to continue working.<nl><nl>Switching from <ee>Normal<rr> to <ee>Inverted<rr> mode will make the Machine Controller instead disable the machine until it receives the requisite redstone signal. This is often preferable when working with <66>Level Emitters<rr> to prevent machines from starting up if your <ee>ME Network<rr> is offline.<nl><nl>Some use cases:<nl>• Control machines through vanilla redstone contraptions or a simple lever.<nl><nl>• The <66>Redstone Upgrades<rr> from <bb>Storage Drawers<rr> can be used when outputting into a drawer to make the drawer emit redstone that can control the machine.<nl><nl>• When you progress to digital storage, an <66>ME Level Emitter<rr> or <66>ME Fluid Level Emitter<rr> can be used to emit signal based on specific items or fluids in your network.<nl>
